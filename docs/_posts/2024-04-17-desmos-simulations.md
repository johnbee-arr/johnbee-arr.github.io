## Desmos for Statistics
One of the motivations for learning coding has come from creating [desmos](https://www.desmos.com/calculator) simulations to convey statistical ideas as part of the A level further maths statistics course for teachers I have helped develop. You can do a surprisingly deep amount within desmos including for loops and list management. When this is combined with in-built statistical distributions and the ability to create random samples easily, you can create some pretty powerful simulations.

Here are a few I have made with descriptions. They are free to copy and play around with.

## [Poisson distributions as a limit of the binomial](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/vare6rugow)
This file simulates both a binomial and Poisson distribution with the same expected value. It demonstrates the property that a binomial distribution tends to a Poisson as n tends to infinity.
